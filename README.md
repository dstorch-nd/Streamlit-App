# Streamlit-App

This is a sentiment analysis app built using Streamlit that allows users to input song lyrics and determine the sentiment of the text. This was my introductory project into Streamlit and building interactive web applications with Python. I used Streamlit for building the interactive web app, Python for backend logic and sentiment analysis, and sentiment analysis libraries for computing sentiment scores.

Features

    Input song lyrics directly into the app.
    Select a sentiment analysis method (e.g., Intensity).
    View a compound sentiment score and a corresponding sentiment classification (positive, neutral, or negative).

Have fun!
